# Dashboard Images

## Instructions for Adding Dashboard Screenshots

1. **Take a screenshot of your dashboard**:
   - Run `python run_investment_system.py dashboard`
   - Open the generated HTML file in your browser
   - Take a screenshot of the full dashboard or key sections

2. **Process the screenshot**:
   - Recommended dimensions: 1200px wide, aspect ratio 16:9
   - Ensure text is readable
   - Optimize file size (PNG format recommended for quality)

3. **Add the screenshots to this directory**:
   - Name the main overview screenshot `dashboard_preview.png`
   - For additional screenshots, use descriptive names:
     - `predictions_section.png`
     - `portfolio_allocation.png`
     - `performance_metrics.png`
     - `json_viewer.png`

4. **Update the README.md**:
   - Ensure the image paths are correct
   - Consider adding captions to explain what each screenshot demonstrates
