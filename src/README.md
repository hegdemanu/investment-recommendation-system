# Source Code Directory

This directory contains the core implementation of the Investment Recommendation System. Each module is designed to handle a specific part of the system's functionality.

## Modules

### `data_processor.py`
- Handles loading data from various sources (CSV files, APIs)
- Performs data preprocessing and cleaning
- Executes feature engineering and transformation
- Manages data normalization and scaling

### `model_trainer.py`
- Implements LSTM model creation and training
- Provides data drift detection to identify when retraining is needed
- Handles saving and loading of trained models
- Generates short-term predictions using trained models

### `risk_analyzer.py`
- Calculates volatility, Sharpe ratio, and other risk metrics
- Classifies investments into risk categories (Low, Medium, High)
- Evaluates maximum drawdown and risk-adjusted returns
- Provides systematic risk assessment for all securities

### `recommendation_engine.py`
- Generates investment recommendations based on predictions and risk profiles
- Creates optimized portfolios based on user risk tolerance
- Allocates investment amounts across recommended securities
- Produces portfolio performance reports and metrics

### `long_term_models.py`
- Implements ARIMA-GARCH models for medium-term predictions
- Provides Prophet model implementation for long-term forecasting
- Creates ensemble predictions combining multiple model outputs
- Handles specialized forecasting for longer time horizons

### `report_generator.py`
- Creates detailed technical reports in various formats (PDF, Excel)
- Generates visualization charts and graphs
- Formats investment recommendations and portfolio allocations
- Provides exportable results for sharing and presentation

## Integration

These modules work together in a pipeline:
1. Data is processed by `data_processor.py`
2. Models are trained using `model_trainer.py` and `long_term_models.py`
3. Risk profiles are generated by `risk_analyzer.py`
4. Recommendations are created by `recommendation_engine.py`
5. Reports are generated using `report_generator.py`

Each module can be used independently for specific tasks or combined in the full pipeline for end-to-end investment analysis.
